Abstract
: All terms in the Plant-Pollinator Interactions Vocabulary must be assigned a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For convenience, the term URIs that are assigned and managed by REBIPP are grouped into collections known as Plant-Pollinator Interactions namespaces. This document describes how term URIs are allocated by REBIPP and the policies associated with Plant-Pollinator Interactions namespaces.

## 1 Introduction

This document and the policies contained herein are modeled on the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Namespace Policy](http://dublincore.org/documents/2007/07/02/dcmi-namespace/). All terms in the Plant-Pollinator Interactions vocabulary (PPI) must be identified with a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For convenience, the term URIs are grouped into collections known as _Plant-Pollinator Inteactions namespaces_. This document describes the policies associated with Plant-Pollinator Inteactions namespaces and how term URIs are allocated by [REBIPP](http://www.rebipp.org.br).

### 1.1 Status of the content of this document

All sections of this document are normative.

### 1.2 Audience

This document is targeted toward those who want to make changes to the Plant-Pollinator Inteactions vocabulary, either by refining terms that already exist or by adding new terms to increase the capabilities of the standard.

## 2 Namespace URIs

The Plant-Pollinator Inteactions namespace URI for the collection of general properties, classes, and encoding schemes is:

```
http://rs.rebipp.org.br/ppi/terms/
```

The term identifier for the current (recommended) version of a term is a URI based on the namespace and the term name without version information. Some example term identifiers follow:

```
http://rs.rebipp.org.br/ppi/terms/flowerShape
```

is the term identifier for the `flowerShape` property, while

```
http://rs.rebipp.org.br/ppi/terms/Plant
```

is the term identifier for the `Plant` class (used only to organize terms into categories).

All Plant-Pollinator Inteactions vocabulary identifiers will dereference to a term declaration for the identified term.

## 3 Term change policy

(This section has been superseded by the [TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md))

## 4 Persistence policy

[REBIPP](https://www.rebipp.org.br/) recognizes that people and applications depend on the persistence of formal documents and machine processable schemas that have been made publicly available. In particular, the stability of Plant-Pollinator Inteactions term URIs and Plant-Pollinator Inteactions namespace URIs is critical to interoperability over time. Thus, the wide promulgation of this set of URIs dictates that they be maintained to support legacy applications that have adopted them.
