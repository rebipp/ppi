# Dataset Example (complex)

A more complex example of plant-pollinator interactions data [example-complex](/examples/example-complex.pdf).

## Original Data

The dataset was extracted from a supplementary material of publication, and contains multiple separated tables as show bellow:

### Plant species list and floral abundances

Species | Species Acronym | Number of flowers | Relative abundances
-- | -- | -- | -- 
Aechmea cf. organensis Wawra | Aec_org | 19 | 0.000226376
Aechmea distichantha Lem. | Aec_dis | 106 | 0.001262942
Aechmea gamosepala Wittm. | Aec_gam | 41 | 0.000488497

**Table A1**: *Abundances of 55 hummingbird-pollinated species quantified along 12000m of trails in the Atlantic Rainforest at Santa Virgínia Field Station, southeastern Brazil. Number of flowers (or inflorescences, for Asteraceae species) was counted monthtly from September 2011 to August 2013 and relative abundances indicate the relativa proportion of flowers accounted by each species calculated on the total number of flowers.**

### Hummingbird species and occurrence frequencies

Species | Acronym | Contacts in transects | Frequency of occurrence | Relative frequencies
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Phaethornis eurynome (Lesson. 1832) | Pe | 86 | 86.923 | 0.288
Thalurania glaucopis (Gmelin. 1788) | Tg | 28 | 78.462 | 0.260
Clytolaema rubricauda (Boddaert. 1783) | Cr | 18 | 66.923 | 0.222

**Table A2**: *Abundances of nine hummingbird species ocurring in the Atlantic Rainforest from September 2011 to Augusto 2013 at Santa Virgínia Field Station, southeastern Brazil. Contacts in transects indicate the total number of aural and visual contacts with individuals counted monthly across ten transects (100m each); frequency of occurrence is the proportion of days in which a species was recorded across 12000m of trails percurred and over 130 days of fieldwork; and the realtive frequency is the relative proportion accounted by each species calculated on the frequency of occurrences.*

### Plant phenology

Species acronym | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
Aec_org | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  
Aec_dis | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1

**Table A3**: *Plant phenology quantified by the monthly presence/absence of flowers of 55 hummingbird-pollinated species from September 2011 to August 2013 in the 12000m of trails in the Atlantic Rainforest at Santa Virgí
nia Field Station, southeastern Brazil. Species acronym according Table A1. In total, 130 days of sampling were spread along the years.

### Plant measurements

Species acronym | Minium corolla depth (cm) | Mean ± sd corolla depth (cm)
-- | -- | --
Aec_org | 1.04 | 1.21 ± 0.17 (n=4)
Aec_dis | 1.22 | 1.29 ± 0.07 (n=3)
Aec_gam | 0.85 | 1.08 ± 0.23 (n=8)

**Table A5**: *Minimum corolla depth in 55 hummingbird-pollinated sepceis in Atlantic Rainforests from September 2011 to August 2013in the 12000m of trails in the Atlantic Rainforest ad Santa Virgínia Field Station, southeastern Brazil. Corolla depth was measured as the internal distance from the base of the nectar chamber to the distal portion of the flower (i.e. effective corolla length. sensu Wolf. Stiles & Hainsworth 1976), which represents the minimum mouth apparatus length needed to a hummingbird access the nectar legintimately.*

### Hummingbirds bill length

Species acronym | Mean bill length ± sd (cm) | Tongue extension (cm)* | Bill + tongue
-- | -- | -- | --
Pe | 3.33 ± 0.12 (n=12) | 2.72 | 6.12
Tg | 1.79 ± 0.08 (n=6) | 1.44  | 3.24
Cr | 1.90 (n=1) | 1.52 | 3.42

**Table A6**: *bill length (exposed culmen). Estimated tongue extension and bill + tongue estimation of nine hummingbird species in the Atlantic Rainforest at Santa Virgínia Field Station, southeastern Brazil. \*Tongue extension estimated based on Selasphorus rufus measures, which is around 80% of the bill length (Grant & Temeles 1992).*

### Geogrophical coordinates

Transect | Starting point | Ending point
-- | -- | --
Transect 1 | S 23°20.229. W 45°08.965 | S 23°20.313. W 45°09.020
Transect 2 | S 23°20.430. W 45°09.332 | S 23°20.486. W 45°09.353
Transect 3 | S 23°20.575. W 45°09.318 | S 23°20.658. W 45°09.337

**Table A7**: *geographical coordinates of starting and ending points of ten transects (100m long) where er counted hummingbirds monthly at Santa Virgínia Field Stattion, southeastern Brazil.*
