## 1 Introduction (Informative)

This document contains terms that are part of the most recent version of the Plant-Pollinator Interactions vocabulary (<http://rs.rebipp.org.br/version/ppi/2021-12-03>).

This document includes terms in the namespace `ppi` that contain recommended terms. However, some terms in these namespaces are deprecated or superseded and should no longer be used. Deprecation or supersession is noted in the term metadata. Namespaces that contain only deprecated terms are not included in this document, but metadata about those terms can be retrieved by dereferencing their IRIs.

For a simplified list that contains only the currently recommended terms, see the [Quick Reference Guide](../terms/).

### 1.1 Status of the content of this document

Sections 1 and 3 are non-normative.

Section 2 is normative.

In Section 4, the values of the `Term IRI` and `Definition` are normative. The values of `Term Name` are non-normative, although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace.  `Label` and the values of all other properties (such as `Examples` and `Notes`) are non-normative.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words

## 2 Use of Terms

The terms in the Plant-Pollinator Interactions vocabulary are meant to be used as controlled vocabulary for the terms in [Darwin Core Standard](http://dwc.tdwg.org): `dwc:measurementType`, `dwc:measurementValue` and `dwciri:measurementType`. However, the terms could be used with other extensions like the [OBIS ExtendedMeasurementOrFact](https://obis.org/manual/dataformat/) providing a controlled vocabulary for `obis:measurementTypeID` and `obis:measurementValueID`.

See [PPI Text Guide](../text/), [PPI XML Guide](../xml/) and [PPI RDF Guide](../rdf/) for details.
