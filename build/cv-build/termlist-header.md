## 1 Introduction

This document includes terms intended to be used as a controlled value for Plant-Pollinator Interactions terms.

### 1.1 Status of the content of this document

In Section 4, the values of the `Term IRI`, `Definition`, and `Controlled value` are normative. The value of `Usage` (if it exists for a given term) is normative.  The values of `Term Name` are non-normative, although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace.  `Label` and the values of all other properties (such as `Notes`) are non-normative.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words
